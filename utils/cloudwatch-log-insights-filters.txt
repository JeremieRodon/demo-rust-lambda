Select all 8 Lambda logGroups, ensure that the period of time you are looking up covers your tests,
then use this query to display the stats for each lambda:
-------------------------------------------------------------

filter @type = "REPORT"
| stats avg(@duration) as avgDuration,
  min(@duration) as minDuration,
  max(@duration) as maxDuration,
  stddev(@duration) as StdDevDuration,
  avg(@billedDuration) as avgBilled,
  min(@billedDuration) as minBilled,
  max(@billedDuration) as maxBilled,
  stddev(@billedDuration) as StdDevBilled,
  avg(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as avgMemoryUsedMB,
  min(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as minMemoryUsedMB,
  max(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as maxMemoryUsedMB,
  stddev(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as StdDevMemoryUsedMB
